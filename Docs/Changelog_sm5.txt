================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 $next | 20111xxx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/11/30
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Added IsEasierForSongAndSteps(Song,Steps,PlayerNumber) and
  IsEasierForCourseAndTrail(Course, Trail) Lua bindings. [AJ]
* [PlayerState] Added GetSuperMeterLevel() Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/11/28
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] Add the SurvivalModOverride metric. Let the themer decide
  if mods should be overridden on survival or not. Funny enough, this used
  to be true for the old Oni style mode, but...well, we'll cross that bridge
  later. [Wolfman2000]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added MaxLives metric, which limits the maximum amount of
  lives. Setting this to 0 will remove the limit. [AJ]

2011/11/27
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Pretty large changes here, namely a bunch of new bindings.
  Fixed the logic for GetReversePercentForColumn; It will now return nil for
  invalid columns. Also fixed the logic for UsingReverse (now checks for 1.0f)
  and SetPassmark (no longer allows values < 0.00f and > 1.0f). [AJ]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow inserting and removing beats and timing changes in
  specific note increments instead of just quarter notes (a whole beat).
  Those that prefer to keep using the shortcut keys will note that the
  behavior has not changed for that: only by going into the Area menu can you
  deal with more specific changes. [Wolfman2000]

2011/11/26
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Restore using F9 and F10 to adjust stops by a fixed amount.
  Sorry for the delay in this. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Minor convenience. If you attempt to create a negative stop
  segment from scratch, it does not create, and you are not requested to
  save on exit, for there is nothing to save. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow Shift + F9/F10 for adjusting delays. This works the same
  way as adjusting stops. [Wolfman2000]

2011/11/25
----------
* [PlayerStageStats] Hitting a mine no longer gives you full combo when
  [Gameplay] MineHitIncrementsMissCombo=true. [AJ]

2011/11/24
----------
* [PlayerStageStats] Added GetFailed and GetNumControllerSteps Lua bindings. [AJ]

2011/11/15
----------
* [LifeMeterBar] Added the ForceLifeDifficultyOnExtraStage metric and
  the ExtraStageLifeDifficulty metric. Let the themer decide if extra stages 
  should have their own life bar behavior. Note that this metric does NOT 
  change the lifebar to the battery style. [Wolfman2000/FSX]

2011/11/14
----------
* [Mac OS X] Restore JPEG functionality. [Wolfman2000]

2011/11/06
----------
* [GameState] Add the RefreshNoteSkinData lua binding. This will only
  refresh the NS data for the present game, not all games. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Fixed Rave difficulties not being synced on late join.
  Fixes issue 577. [AJ]
* [GameplayAssist] Don't play sounds if the player is dead. Fixes issue 621. [AJ]

2011/11/04
* [ScoreKeeperRave] Revert fix from 2011/10/28. [AJ]
* [ScoreKeeperRave] Fixed Miss and HitMine giving meter life.
  (Fixes issue 622.) [AJ]

2011/11/02
----------
* [ArchHooks] Add the GetArchName lua binding. To the themers that use
  GetOSName, that function may be deprecated in the future. For now,
  both options exist. [vyhd, Wolfman2000]

2011/11/01
----------
* [ArrowEffects] Fix Expand, and possibly other mods, from breaking if
  using a second player. [Wolfman2000]
* [ArchHooks] Add the AppHasFocus lua binding. [vyhd, Wolfman2000]

2011/10/29
----------
* [GameState] Add the ResetPlayerOptions lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/28
----------
* [ScoreKeeperRave] Fix an issue where the super meter would not decrease back
  to 1 after hitting the end of 3. (Fixes issue 314.) [AJ]

2011/10/27
----------
* [Default theme] Fixed the pref controlling timing segments on song meter. [FSX]

2011/10/18
----------
* [LightsManager] Use song beat for menu button lights, allow demonstration to
  flash pad lights when BlinkGameplayButtonLightsOnNote is true, light custom
  game buttons when pressed during attract mode, general optimizations. [vyhd]

2011/10/17
----------
* [ScreenEdit/NoteField] Fix an editor crash when you exit without saving
  after creating new steps. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/16
----------
* [NoteDataUtil] Add the Backwards mod for games where the intended
  definition of Mirror is different. Regarding Pump gameplay, what was
  called Mirror in Preview 4 is considered Backwards now, and the original
  Mirror is back in its old position. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/12
----------
* [Steps] Fix a bug where e.g. ".SM" ".DWI" ".Sm" ".sM" files
  wouldn't properly load since the code was expecting lowercase. [AJ]

2011/10/10
----------
* [NotesLoaderBMS] Add the time signature segments. [theDtTvB]

2011/10/09
----------
* [NotesLoaderBMS] Fix the bug where keysounds that points to nonexistant file
  gets assigned a random one. [theDtTvB]
* [NotesLoaderBMS] Use BMSLoader to load PMS files. [theDtTvB]
* [RageSoundReader_WAV] Fix ADPCM support. [theDtTvB]

2011/10/08
----------
* [GameSoundManager] Add the PlayMusicPart lua binding. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add the FadeInPreview and FadeOutPreview metrics. This controls
  how long the fade in and fade outs are for playing the preview music.
  The default values are 0 and 1.5 respectively. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/07
----------
* [RageDisplay] Add the GetFPS, GetVPF, and GetCumFPS bindings. [Wolfman2000]

2011/10/06
----------
* Various scoring fixes sourced from http://www47.atwiki.jp/waiei/pages/21.html
 [A.C/@waiei, 桜為小鳩/@sakuraponila]

* [UnlockManager] Added GetStepOfAllTypes Lua binding. This gets the locked
  Steps for all game types based on the difficulty specified. [Wolfman2000]

2011/08/21

================================================================================

* [Song] Add ShowInDemonstrationAndRanking() Lua binding. [AJ]
* Turn off Autogen by default. [shakesoda]
* Disable automatic aspect ratio guessing, default to 854x480
  (16:9 because most newer displays are wide). [shakesoda]
* Turn on FastLoad and FastLoadAdditionalSongs by default. [shakesoda]

2011/08/18
----------

* [Course] Add IsPlayableIn(StepsType) and IsRanking() Lua bindings. [AJ]
* [Trail] Added GetTotalMeter(), GetLengthSeconds(), IsSecret()

2011/08/16
----------
* Added PrettyPercent(numerator,denominator) Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/08/14
----------
* [Foreground] Restore Foreground Changes for use in gameplay. Note that it
  is recommended to use lua for #FGCHANGES from now on: not all XML changes
  will work. [infamouspat]

2011/08/13
----------
* [Theme-side] Added Fancy UI Background preference to Theme Options. [AJ]
* [LowLevelWindow_X11] Don't force the window into the upper left corner. [ZipFile]

2011/08/07
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LostLife param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Converted LifeMeterBattery lives to an AutoActor. [AJ]
* [TimingData] Add HasDelays() Lua binding; HasStops() now only checks stops. [AJ]

  not using joint premium. [AJ]
* [BeginnerHelper] Made BeginnerHelper run the OnCommand. [AJ]
* [GameState] add GetExpandedSectionName() Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added IdleCommentSeconds metric and
  "ScreenSelectMusic IdleComment" announcer sound. [AJ]
* [NotesLoaderBMS] "Send the actual song file to LoadFromBMSFile in
  BMSLoader::LoadNoteDataFromSimfile instead of the dummy one...
  This fixes the wrong sound issue [423]..." [theDtTvB]

2011/08/06
----------
* [NoteSkins/beat/default] Fix Issue 425. [AJ]
* [ScoreDisplayRave] Allow (Meter/Level)(X/Y) metrics to work again. [AJ]

2011/08/05
----------
* [NoteField] Added AreaHighlightColor metric. [AJ]

2011/08/04
----------
* [NoteTypes, ScreenEdit] Removed artificial MAX_NOTES_PER_MEASURE limit. [AJ]

2011/08/02
----------
* [NotesSSC] Only write timing/attack tags for the step if there is a
  difference from the song. For timing tags, at this time it means that if even
  one tag is different, all tags are written. [Wolfman2000]

2011/08/01
----------
* [MusicWheel, RoomWheel] Moved the "- EMPTY -" string to the languages file. [AJ]

2011/07/31
----------

  Fixes issue 298. [AJ]

2011/07/30
----------
* [ProfileManager] Fix an issue when deleting recently created profiles. [AJ]
* Start removing anything related to Guitar mode. This was rushed in, and it
  is not worth us keeping at this time. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/26
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a semi working implementation of the often requested
  copy/paste selected timing data feature. This should make it easier for
  some charters. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/21
----------
* [BeginnerHelper] Removed DancePadAngle metric in favor of DancePadOnCommand.
  The same goes for PlayerAngle, dancer rotation is now handled in
  PlayerP1/2OnCommand. [AJ]
* [Course] Bumped up max edit course title length to 16 (still feels too short).
  Also added #DESCRIPTION tag and Course:GetDescription() Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/07/20
----------
* [Win32/CrashHandlerChild] Crashlog and log now open in the player's default
  text editor. Also, the Show Log button works again, including for people using
  Portable.ini. [AJ]

2011/07/19
----------
* [LoadingWindow] Added the ability for themes to have custom splash banners.
  (Currently Windows-only.) [AJ]

2011/07/17
----------
* [Cache] No longer store #NOTES in the cache. This should speed things up
  on the first load if there is not much to write. (General note: this was
  taken from another branch, but results at that point were great.)
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/13
----------
* [Difficulty] Allow ALL StepsTypes to use CustomDifficulty properly.
  There was some unfair targeting of Couple and Routine. [Wolfman2000]
* [Steps] Calculate accurate radar values for Couple charts. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Display more accurate chart data for Couple and Routine charts
  for the future. No more having (almost) every row as a jump! [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/12
----------
* [OptionRowHandler] Add a new metric to ScreenOptionsMaster:
  StepsUseChartName. Use this if you want your charts to have a unique name
  in the options menu. If there is no #CHARTNAME or it is "Blank", it reverts
  to the original behavior. This metric is false by default. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a bug involving #ATTACKS. Now when you set an attack,
  the mods are reverted back to how they were prior to the attack being set.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/09
----------
* [NotesTheUsual] Update the #COMBOS tag to allow for a Miss Combo attribute.
  Any files that only use the Combo attribute will have that value copied to
  miss combo on next launch. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Better match #COMBOS with eval. Scoring formulas should
  not be affected, but it may require more testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [Metrics] Have Pump mode lump the checkpoint judgments with Flawless and
  Miss judgments on eval. Of course, this goes down to Perfect and Miss if
  that is disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/07
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the NoMines transformation bug, issue 363. [Wolfman2000]
* [CourseLoaderCRS] Don't load BEST# and WORST# where # is greater than the
  number of songs installed. Fixes issue 373. [AJ]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the #CHARTNAME tag to the Steps. #DESCRIPTION is now for
  more detailed descriptions, or perhaps some short hand lingo. All files
  that used #DESCRIPTION will have their values moved to #CHARTNAME on
  load. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a Steps Data menu for getting numerical step data on the
  chart. This is a read only menu. Edit Steps Information contains writable
  information. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesAllSSC] Add the Steps version of #DISPLAYBPM. The Song version is
  still there, so themes should not have to worry about breakage.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/06
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix the bug where hitting Enter during playing wouldn't take
  the user back to the editor. [Wolfman2000]
* [Gameplay] Fix Fail mods being dishonored. [Midiman]

2011/07/05
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Restore dance-couple and pump-couple for editing purposes.
  Saving should still work, but this was never tested yet. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenOptions] Mini is now ITG Mini, and Tiny is now Pump Pro Mini.
  This will prevent many prior courses from breaking. [sharksoda, Wolfman2000]
* [CharacterManager] Add a lua function to check how many characters you have.
  For an example of how this is used, check the default theme's scripts
  folder, specifically 03 ThemePrefs.lua. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/04
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to switch the notes the routine players have to
  hit. In simple terms, Player 1's notes are now Player 2's and vice~versa.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add two routine mirroring functions. Now you can build sections
  of a chart for one player, and mirror the effect for the other player when
  finished. For Pump players, it is not a straight mirror, but is more akin
  to what is found via normal routine charts. In other words, you'll be happy.
  Check it out in the Alter Menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/07/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if one tries to remove an attack that doesn't
  exist at that time. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 2 | 20110703
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/07/03
----------
* [Player] Bring mMods from OpenITG over. Also, a metric was added,
  "MModHighCap", to cap the speed mod if required for playing songs like
  Tsuhsuixamush. Set the metric to 0 or less to remove the cap. [AJ, sharksoda,
  Wolfman2000]

2011/07/02
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Fixed a crash when hitting Enter in the F1 help menu. [AJ]

2011/06/30
----------
* [NotesAll] Use #FIRSTSECOND, #LASTSECOND, and #LASTSECONDHINT instead of the
  former BEAT equivalents. Split Timing has made this a necessity thanks to
  certain files that abuse Stops/Delays more than usual. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function in the Area Menu to designate the current beat
  as the last second of the song. Please try to be smart and not use this too
  early. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/28
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Add a function to copy/paste the TimingData of a player's
  choice. Remember to be in the appropriate mode when copying and pasting.
  By default, the song timing is already located in the clipboard, ready for
  use. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/27
----------
* [Steps] Make sure #ATTACKS are copied when requested. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Have Step Author up front instead of Chart Style. This is
  probably going to be better overall. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Preserve the length of time for Speed Segment scaling when using
  beats. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] #OFFSET is to be before #ATTACKS. This is required if
  we pursue beat based attacks and not just second based. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/26
----------
* [UnlockManager] New metric: AutoLockEditSteps. Use this to hide bonus charts
  until the Expert steps are beaten. No guarantee that this works with no
  challenge steps in the song. This defaults to false. [Wolfman2000]
* [UnlockManager] New metric: SongsNotAdditional. Set to true to keep the
  default behavior, false to have the AdditionalSongs folder contain
  unlockable material. This is set to true to start. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow jumping between all segments, not just Label segments.
  You still use Ctrl + ,/. to jump, but now you use Ctrl + N/M to cycle the
  segments. By default, it starts with Label. [Wolfman2000]
* [PlayerOptions] No longer display StepAttacks in the player's list.
  Instead, show NoAttacks if attacks are disabled. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/24
----------
* [Actor] Implement compound(length,tweens) in _fallback/02 Actor.lua. [AJ]
* [UnlockManager] Add a new unlock reward: StepsType. This is similar to
  unlocking Steps, but it is targeted for one step in one stepstype rather
  than one step in all stepstypes. This needs testing. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Add the option to convert delays to beats. Just find a better
  song to use this on besides Uprock. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix a crash if you don't save any steps on a new song.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoader/WriterSSC] Add support for Step #ATTACKS. Furthermore, Song
  Attacks (or rather, Step Attacks as it should be called now) are turned on
  by default instead of off. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/19
----------
* [EditMenu] Allow all songs to work in Practice Mode, regardless of folder
  location. This fixes a crash if everyone had songs in AdditionalSongs.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/17
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Fixed a bug where MinesSubtractLives was not being honored.
  Also added LifeChanged message to changing of life on holds. [AJ]

2011/06/15
----------
* [TimingData] Added many lua bindings for the other timing segments. GetWarps,
  GetCombos, GetTimeSignatures, GetTickcounts, GetFakes, GetScrolls, GetSpeeds.
  This should cover all of them now. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/13
----------
* [InputHandler_DirectInput] Fixed MouseWheel input not resetting. [AJ]
* [ScreenTextEntry] Make it so only the keyboard's Enter key can finish the
  screen. Should fix issues with buttons whose secondary function is MenuStart. [AJ]
* [InputMapper] Modify default mappings. Use the Hyphen key instead of the
  Numlock key for Player 2's GAME_BUTTON_BACK. This should address some
  issues with Player 2 being unable to back out if they use a laptop.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDisplay] Add two new metrics.
 * DrawRollHeadForTapsOnSameRow: bool, similar to DrawHoldHeadForTapsOnSameRow
 * TapHoldRollOnRowMeansHold: bool, true means hold and false means roll
 * No noteskins should require updating, as these were placed in common/common
   for ease of use. [Wolfman2000]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added ChangeLives(int) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added DangerThreshold metric. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added some important metrics. [AJ]
 * MinScoreToKeepLife='TapNoteScore_*' - any score below this = loss of life.
 * SubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when going below MinScoreToKeepLife.
 * MinesSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when hitting a mine.
 * HeldAddLives=0 - how many lives are gained when a hold is completed.
 * LetGoSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost on a dropped hold.

2011/06/12
----------
* [ScreenNetSelectMusic] Add PlayerOptionsScreen metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenEdit] Restore the old PageUp/PageDown behavior, added Control + 
  PageUp/PageDown to use recent time signature behavior. Laptop users, that
  includes you guys too: semicolon and apostrophe are still good. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/11
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow setting the Music Preview via the Alter Menu. Just select
  your area, enter the menu, and choose "Designate as Music Preview". No more
  math calculations needed! [Wolfman2000]
* [SongUtil] Added GetPlayableSteps(Song) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [Steps] Allow 255 characters for all chart descriptions, including edits.
  We are no longer bound by In The Groove I think. [Wolfman2000]
* [Player] Add GetPlayerTimingData() Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/10
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Split the Area Menu into the Area Menu and Alter Menu. Use the
  "A" key to enter the Alter Menu when a selection of notes/rows are
  highlighted. Use the Enter key to enter the old Area Menu for the options that
  do not depend on selecting NoteData. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow converting selections to Delays, Warps, or Fakes as well
  as Stops. Remember, use the Alter Menu for this. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/09
----------
* [ScreenSyncOverlay] Ensure that F11 / F12 work with all charts due to Split
  Timing. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/08
----------
* Any notes in a fake segment or warp segment are completely ignored for
  scoring purposes. Now you can get 100% on your warping goodness!
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/06
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Removed the ScoreDisplay mod choices. Use lua to make your
  own scoring formulas that work in reverse instead. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenGameplay] Fix an assist tick bug if there was no Player 1. Note that
  this changes the behavior slightly: it is the first enabled player, or
  master player, that gets the ticks now. A better solution will be looked at
  in the future. [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDataUtil] Fix a radar issue involving hands. Unfortunately, this means
  yet another cache reload for accuracy purposes. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/04
----------
* Changed default MusicWheelSwitchSpeed to 15 (was 10). [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Fixed a bug where no announcers would be loaded. [AJ]
* Restored the UserPrefAutoSetStyle behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoaderSMA] Better way of identifying beats and seconds. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1a | 20110603
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/06/03
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LivesLeft param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [Windows] Set up directories for pictures and app data in their proper
  location. [Henke]
* [NotesLoaderSM] Fix an Offset load bug. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/02
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromSteps Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Switch the R and T keys to be Volume Down and Up
  respectively. I have to admit, it makes more sense to have volume up be
  on the right instead of the left. [Wolfman2000]
* [SongManager] Make autogen courses have "Autogen" as the Scripter. [AJ]

2011/06/01
----------
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix Song Timing behaviors. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/31
----------
* [Player] Added the BattleRaveMirror metric. This determines if Battle and
  Rave mode will have the two players with mirrored charts or not. By default,
  this is set to true, preserving the ITG style behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1 | 20110529
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/05/27
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Added the LoopOnChartEnd metric. Once you get to the end of
  the chart while playing it in the editor, this controls whether it loops and
  plays again, or simply stops. By default, this is true, replicating current
  behavior. Set to false to replicate older StepMania behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/26
----------
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Added the MissComboIsPerRow metric. Similar to the
  ComboIsPerRow metric, this determines how much miss combo is earned on missing
  a row of notes. By default, this is true. Set to false to replicate Pump Pro
  behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/25
----------
* [NotesLoaderSSC/NotesWriterSSC] Added the ScrollSegments. Think BPM change,
  but not. [theDtTvB]

2011/05/23
----------
* [Steps] Added the UsesSplitTiming Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/20
----------
* [CryptManager] Added SHA1File Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/19
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Add CourseCycleSpeed metric. [AJ]

2011/05/17
----------
* [NotesWriterSM] Write out OpenITG compatible SM files from here on out.
  This includes turning Warps into Negative Stops. For those that wanted
  negative BPMs specifically, my apologies, but stops are easier on math.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/16
----------
* [ProfileManager] Added ProfileWasLoadedFromMemoryCard(PlayerNumber)
  Lua binding. [AJ]
* Added #FAKES to the SSC format. Similar to the fake arrows, these blocks
  prevent all judgments within the range. [Wolfman2000]
* Changed the syntax of #WARPS slightly. Now the second value is the relative
  distance that is skipped, not the absolute value when you start hitting
  arrows again. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/15
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] Removed hardcoded commands for Debug (give up text) and
  replace them with DebugStartOnCommand, DebugBackOnCommand, and
  DebugTweenOffCommand. [AJ] 
* Added #SPEEDS to the SSC format. This multiplies your scrolling speed during
  gameplay, not replaces it (see mod attacks for replacing). [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/14
----------
* [ModIcon] Added StopWords metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMaster] Add "ScreenEmpty" param to MenuStartP# when the GameCommand
  doesn't set a screen. [AJ]
* [StepsDisplay] Added MeterFormatString metric. [AJ]
* [MusicWheel] Added ShowSectionsInBPMSort and ShowSectionsInLengthSort metrics. [AJ]
* [ScreenEvaluation] Stop the Bonus bars from overflowing in course modes. [AJ]
* [Banner] Added ScrollMode and ScrollSortOrder metrics. [AJ]

2011/05/13
----------
* Added Split Timing to .SSC files. All older .SSC files and other file
  formats are converted to split timing on cache load. We are no longer bound
  by Song Timing for everything. [theDtTvB, Wolfman2000, TeruFSX]

2011/05/11
----------
* [GameSoundManager] Added PlayAnnouncer Lua binding. [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Add support for "gameplay combo #" for announcer. [AJ]

2011/05/10
----------
* [Sprite] Added SetSecondsIntoAnimation Lua binding. [AJ]
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromCourse Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow changing the Beat 0 Offset, Music Sample Start, and
  Music Sample Length via Edit Song Info menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/02
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added NullScoreString metric. [AJ]

2011/04/17
--------
* Use lua for all primary score keeping. Course modes right now still use the
  old fashioned system. [TeruFSX, Wolfman2000]

2011/04/09
--------
* [Player] Force hold judgments to take place before setting the score.
  [theDtTvB]

2011/04/05
--------
* [NotesLoaderSSC, NotesWriterSSC] Add the #LABELS tag. This is meant for step
  editors to label different parts of their stepcharts. Use Control + , or . to
  jump to different labels made. [Wolfman2000]
