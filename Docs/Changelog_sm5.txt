================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 2 | 20110???
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/06/13
----------
* [InputHandler_DirectInput] Fixed MouseWheel input not resetting. [AJ]
* [ScreenTextEntry] Make it so only the keyboard's Enter key can finish the
  screen. Should fix issues with buttons whose secondary function is MenuStart. [AJ]
* [InputMapper] Modify default mappings. Use the Hyphen key instead of the
  Numlock key for Player 2's GAME_BUTTON_BACK. This should address some
  issues with Player 2 being unable to back out if they use a laptop.
  [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDisplay] Add two new metrics.
 * DrawRollHeadForTapsOnSameRow: bool, similar to DrawHoldHeadForTapsOnSameRow
 * TapHoldRollOnRowMeansHold: bool, true means hold and false means roll
 * No noteskins should require updating, as these were placed in common/common
   for ease of use. [Wolfman2000]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added ChangeLives(int) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added DangerThreshold metric. [AJ]
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added some important metrics. [AJ]
 * MinScoreToKeepLife='TapNoteScore_*' - any score below this = loss of life.
 * SubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when going below MinScoreToKeepLife.
 * MinesSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost when hitting a mine.
 * HeldAddLives=0 - how many lives are gained when a hold is completed.
 * LetGoSubtractLives=1 - how many lives are lost on a dropped hold.

2011/06/12
----------
* [ScreenNetSelectMusic] Add PlayerOptionsScreen metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenEdit] Restore the old PageUp/PageDown behavior, added Control + 
  PageUp/PageDown to use recent time signature behavior. Laptop users, that
  includes you guys too: semicolon and apostrophe are still good. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/11
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow setting the Music Preview via the Alter Menu. Just select
  your area, enter the menu, and choose "Designate as Music Preview". No more
  math calculations needed! [Wolfman2000]
* [SongUtil] Added GetPlayableSteps(Song) Lua binding. [AJ]
* [Steps] Allow 255 characters for all chart descriptions, including edits.
  We are no longer bound by In The Groove I think. [Wolfman2000]
* [Player] Add GetPlayerTimingData() Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/10
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Split the Area Menu into the Area Menu and Alter Menu. Use the
  "A" key to enter the Alter Menu when a selection of notes/rows are
  highlighted. Use the Enter key to enter the old Area Menu for the options that
  do not depend on selecting NoteData. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Allow converting selections to Delays, Warps, or Fakes as well
  as Stops. Remember, use the Alter Menu for this. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/09
----------
* [ScreenSyncOverlay] Ensure that F11 / F12 work with all charts due to Split
  Timing. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/08
----------
* Any notes in a fake segment or warp segment are completely ignored for
  scoring purposes. Now you can get 100% on your warping goodness!
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/06
----------
* [PlayerOptions] Removed the ScoreDisplay mod choices. Use lua to make your
  own scoring formulas that work in reverse instead. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenGameplay] Fix an assist tick bug if there was no Player 1. Note that
  this changes the behavior slightly: it is the first enabled player, or
  master player, that gets the ticks now. A better solution will be looked at
  in the future. [Wolfman2000]
* [NoteDataUtil] Fix a radar issue involving hands. Unfortunately, this means
  yet another cache reload for accuracy purposes. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/04
----------
* Changed default MusicWheelSwitchSpeed to 15 (was 10). [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Fixed a bug where no announcers would be loaded. [AJ]
* Restored the UserPrefAutoSetStyle behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [NotesLoaderSMA] Better way of identifying beats and seconds. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1a | 20110603
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/06/03
----------
* [LifeMeterBattery] Added LivesLeft param to LifeChanged message. [AJ]
* [Windows] Set up directories for pictures and app data in their proper
  location. [Henke]
* [NotesLoaderSM] Fix an Offset load bug. [Wolfman2000]

2011/06/02
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromSteps Lua binding. [AJ]
* [ScreenDebugOverlay] Switch the R and T keys to be Volume Down and Up
  respectively. I have to admit, it makes more sense to have volume up be
  on the right instead of the left. [Wolfman2000]
* [SongManager] Make autogen courses have "Autogen" as the Scripter. [AJ]

2011/06/01
----------
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]
* [ScreenEdit] Fix Song Timing behaviors. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/31
----------
* [Player] Added the BattleRaveMirror metric. This determines if Battle and
  Rave mode will have the two players with mirrored charts or not. By default,
  this is set to true, preserving the ITG style behavior. [Wolfman2000]
* [TimingData] Added the HasScrollChanges lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

================================================================================
StepMania 5.0 Preview 1 | 20110529
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2011/05/27
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Added the LoopOnChartEnd metric. Once you get to the end of
  the chart while playing it in the editor, this controls whether it loops and
  plays again, or simply stops. By default, this is true, replicating current
  behavior. Set to false to replicate older StepMania behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/26
----------
* [ScoreKeeperNormal] Added the MissComboIsPerRow metric. Similar to the
  ComboIsPerRow metric, this determines how much miss combo is earned on missing
  a row of notes. By default, this is true. Set to false to replicate Pump Pro
  behavior. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/25
----------
* [NotesLoaderSSC/NotesWriterSSC] Added the ScrollSegments. Think BPM change,
  but not. [theDtTvB]

2011/05/23
----------
* [Steps] Added the UsesSplitTiming Lua binding. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/20
----------
* [CryptManager] Added SHA1File Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/19
----------
* [BPMDisplay] Add CourseCycleSpeed metric. [AJ]

2011/05/17
----------
* [NotesWriterSM] Write out OpenITG compatible SM files from here on out.
  This includes turning Warps into Negative Stops. For those that wanted
  negative BPMs specifically, my apologies, but stops are easier on math.
  [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/16
----------
* [ProfileManager] Added ProfileWasLoadedFromMemoryCard(PlayerNumber)
  Lua binding. [AJ]
* Added #FAKES to the SSC format. Similar to the fake arrows, these blocks
  prevent all judgments within the range. [Wolfman2000]
* Changed the syntax of #WARPS slightly. Now the second value is the relative
  distance that is skipped, not the absolute value when you start hitting
  arrows again. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/15
----------
* [ScreenGameplay] Removed hardcoded commands for Debug (give up text) and
  replace them with DebugStartOnCommand, DebugBackOnCommand, and
  DebugTweenOffCommand. [AJ] 
* Added #SPEEDS to the SSC format. This multiplies your scrolling speed during
  gameplay, not replaces it (see mod attacks for replacing). [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/14
----------
* [ModIcon] Added StopWords metric. [AJ]
* [ScreenSelectMaster] Add "ScreenEmpty" param to MenuStartP# when the GameCommand
  doesn't set a screen. [AJ]
* [StepsDisplay] Added MeterFormatString metric. [AJ]
* [MusicWheel] Added ShowSectionsInBPMSort and ShowSectionsInLengthSort metrics. [AJ]
* [ScreenEvaluation] Stop the Bonus bars from overflowing in course modes. [AJ]
* [Banner] Added ScrollMode and ScrollSortOrder metrics. [AJ]

2011/05/13
----------
* Added Split Timing to .SSC files. All older .SSC files and other file
  formats are converted to split timing on cache load. We are no longer bound
  by Song Timing for everything. [theDtTvB, Wolfman2000, TeruFSX]

2011/05/11
----------
* [GameSoundManager] Added PlayAnnouncer Lua binding. [AJ]
* [AnnouncerManager] Add support for "gameplay combo #" for announcer. [AJ]

2011/05/10
----------
* [Sprite] Added SetSecondsIntoAnimation Lua binding. [AJ]
* [BPMDisplay] Added SetFromCourse Lua binding. [AJ]

2011/05/03
----------
* [ScreenEdit] Allow changing the Beat 0 Offset, Music Sample Start, and
  Music Sample Length via Edit Song Info menu. [Wolfman2000]

2011/05/02
----------
* [ScreenSelectMusic] Added NullScoreString metric. [AJ]

2011/04/17
--------
* Use lua for all primary score keeping. Course modes right now still use the
  old fashioned system. [TeruFSX, Wolfman2000]

2011/04/09
--------
* [Player] Force hold judgments to take place before setting the score.
  [theDtTvB]

2011/04/05
--------
* [NotesLoaderSSC, NotesWriterSSC] Add the #LABELS tag. This is meant for step
  editors to label different parts of their stepcharts. Use Control + , or . to
  jump to different labels made. [Wolfman2000]
